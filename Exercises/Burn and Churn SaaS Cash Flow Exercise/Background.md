# Burn and Churn SaaS Cash Flow Exercise

## The attached document will take you to a burn and churn exercise as you're the founder of a new SaaS company that created a micro-mobility solution to find transportation options for people living with disabilities.

## You are tasked with finding the following:

- What's your burn rate? In this example, it's the salary of three junior developers.
- What's the total revenue you need to earn to pay your three junior developers with an annual salary of $85,000?
- What's the total number of customers you need to earn to pay your three junior developers with an annual salary of $85,000?
- How many months before you run out of money, operating under the assumption that you cannot pay your three junior developers?
- How many monthly transactions do you need to ensure you hit your revenue goals?
- You have to operate under the assumption that you will not experience hockey-stick growth. Good luck!

	- 95% higher for cash flow on operating costs
- 1/5 Rule of cash flow (operating) - focus on payments received as goal, so you have runway
- Direct cash flow is standard accounting measures
- Indirect cash flow is net income figure from income statement
	- A lot of startups rely on this for runway
	- Indicator of if you have customers paying for products or services
- LTM is a strong metric for startups, especially B2C (business to consumer) and SaaS (software as a service)
	- In terms of last 12 months
	- For SaaS, should go up if charging same price over the last 12 months and cash coming in
	- SaaS platforms rely on this
	- LTM revenue = Most recent quarter figures + Most recent annual figures - Figures in the corresponding quarter 12 months before the most recent quarter
	- Higher LTM is better for startups
- Return on equity is what investors want. For startups, it shows you are worth investing in.
- P/L Metrics
	- Runway - how much money you have before you run out
		- Startup runway (in cash) = current cash balance + burn rate
		- Startup runway (in months) = (current cash balance)/(burn rate)
		- Some equations use starting cash balance and some equations use ending cash balance, so be clear to investors which one you are using in calculating runway
	- Burn rate - how much money are you burning every month
		- Net burn rate is a much better indicator than gross burn rate
		- Net burn rate = (starting cash balance - ending cash balance)/(number of months)
			- 3/6 months is a good indicator as it aligns with quarters
			- Use 6 months as a baseline indicator

- SaaS Cash Flow LTV Equations
	- Predictive
		- Put through predictive from month over month
		-  Cash flow is a good metric to create predictive ML models from
			- Algorithms are stronger with dimensionality reduction
		- Predictive LTV = (T x AOV x AGM x ACL)/C
			- T: number of transactions
			- AOV: average order value
			- AGM: average gross margin
			- ACL: average customer lifetime
			- C: number of customers
	- Flexible
		- Flexible LTV = GML x (R/(1 + D - R))
			- GML: gross margin per customer lifetime
			- R: retention rate
			- D: discount rate
			- R: retention rate
		- Based on retention and discount rates

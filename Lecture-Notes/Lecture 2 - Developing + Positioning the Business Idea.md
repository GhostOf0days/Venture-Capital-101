- Valuation tells you how much you're worth
- Founder who doesn't want to give up equity = probably not successful
- Seed or Series A = Should give enough runway to get to next step
- Series B and Series C can be seen as bad (NOT 100% SURE)
- Some startups take multiple Series A and skip Series B and Series C to go to Series D
- M&A -> Still operate business, lose some stuff, is good
- Market Valuation​ (SEED or SERIES A)
- Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis​ (SERIES B or C)

- Required IRR, Investment, and Term favorable to investors. This is how investors value startups.
- Year 5 Net Income, Year 5 PER favorable to founders. This is what founders value themselves as.
- Investment = How much investors invest
- Term = how long we're going to give you to return money
- Higher Required IRR = more risky investment
- Year 5 Net Income is how much the startup assumes it will generate in sales by year 5 (not cumulative from past years).
- Year 5 PER is you compared to similar startups like you.
- Lower PER = More competitive sector
- Single digit PER is extremely competitive sector
- 18 is a kind of in the middle PER
- Higher PER = Not competitive sector, potentially a risk (more so as market is less saturated, newer market)
- Good Required IRR is around 30%
- Valuation > Sales = investor owns more of company
- Make sure sales are higher than valuation if you're a startup
- Original value is sales pre-investment
- Most investors want at least 9x of investment
- Future Value = (1 + IRR)(term) x investment, where the 1 normalizes the equation (this is what investors want at least 9x)
-  Investors expect you to return future value. You want to beat it and make more than it.
- Pharmaceutical/life science companies typically more than 7 year term. 
- Typical companies have 5 years
- To make it easier on a company, investors give them more time (higher term) or lower the required IRR.
- The average lifespan of an investment is 10 years.
- PER is always negotiated. If investors ask for money and you benchmark a decent amount like 12, investor is just not great to work with. (??? FIX THIS)
- More regulation = higher term.
- Total terminal value = PER (PER in the last year of the term) x terminal net income (net income of the last year of the term)
- VC Realized Investment = Future Value (Realized)
	- What the VC thinks they will get from the company at end of term
- Company Valuation = Total Terminal Value (Realized)
	- What the company thinks it will be worth at end of term
	- Includes IP, etc. not just sales
- Seed and series A = just the valuation.
- Do you take a deal where a VC Realized Investment is $46.75 million and Company Valuation is $63 million?
	- Cash flow could be more important because you don't know what revenue will be post-investment
	- VC could want all that realized investment when term is up if you are not performing well. Otherwise, they could stay.
	- If you will perform, companies may take the same seed to drop IRR, which drops future value/VC realized investment.
	- Closer VC Realized Investment to Company Valuation, more risky
- 75% of terms in term sheet favorable to investors
- B2C has lower risk than B2B
	- Therefore, B2C is lower IRR
- There's pre-money and post-money equity
- % of holding has to add up to 100%
- Founders at start have shares that don't change. Have to make sure shares are non-dilutive.
	- Post-money valuation: Shares stay the same. % of company holding drops.
- As investment stages increase, investor stake increases, founder's stake decreases, and % allocated to employees decrease (later employees have less equity)
- Investors want you to give equity to employees because then they know there's a financial stake in the company's success and are more committed
- Max % allocated to investors at a round -> keep max  given in round at 15%
- Pre-money valuation vs. post-money valuation
	- Pre-money valuation -> Always use 10,000,000 shares as the benchmark of amount of shares pre-money
		- Enables you to hold onto enough and give enough to employees and investors
- Most of the shares for an early startup are  less than a $1. Usually less than or around $0.30.
- Shares and percentages matter in board voting.
- Founders must retain majority of shares to ensure they have voting majority.
- Reserved for stock options = shares for employees
- Investors ask for a board seat. They usually ask for 2 board seats.
	- If you are an early stage startup and an investor asks for 3 board seats, WALK AWAY FROM THE INVESTOR
	- Around 7 board seats is ok. 13 is too many board seats.
- As a founder, never let founder's total %  of holdings go below 25%
- Price per share = valuation/shares
- IRR = (Investment/Current Valuation) * 100
- New Valuation = Investment + Current Valuation
- Dilutive = % ownership goes down, investors get new shares
- Non-dilutive = grants, etc. % ownership stays the same as investors don't get shares
- Investors look like around 15% ownership (this is high threshold you should take)
- Big funds have target ownerships
- Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP)
	- If you're hiring 50 people, don't give equity stake. If 6-10 people, give equity stake (early founders or executives).
	- VC firms look for 10-20%. Investors/pre-seed will look for 5-10%.
	- Only let VCs get 15-20% per round (usually around 15%) -> Dilution of 15-20% per round
	- Look at contractual clause for cash compensation where low salary ($30K or so) until hit revenue target of $1M (at which point employee cash salary increases, say $175K)
	- Use sliding scale (high salary, low equity. low salary, high equity, etc. Choose how to split between two.)
		- Higher equity gives up more stake, but makes employees work harder in the long run to get more money
- Make sure you have non-dilutive shares as a founder. Hold on to shares rather than cash.
- Median ownership of founder at IPO is 9%. Average ownership of founder at IPO is 11%.
- DO NOT HAVE MORE THAN 3 FOUNDERS OR YOU WILL GET DILUTED!
- New total shares is important for dilutive vs. non-dilutive.
	- If you take on another investor and increase sales, share price will increase
		- Total shares same (non-dilutive), but increased valuation increases share price
- IRR is ((difference between old valuation and new valuation)/(old valuation)) * 100
	- Higher IRR = riskier investment
- ALWAYS START AT 10 MILLION SHARES
- As a startup, you want at least 2x company realized over VC realized. Further the company realized and VC realized, the better for you. Also, company realized must be higher
	- VCs can lower IRR to make the deal attractive to the startup given the conditions above

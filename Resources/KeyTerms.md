# Key Terms

## Essential Entrepreneurial Finance Terms

Price: The pre-money valuation is what the investor is valuing the company today, before investment, while the post-money valuation is the pre-money valuation plus the contemplated aggregate investment amount.

Liquidation Preference: Determines how the pie is shared. The term should only pertain to money returned to a particular series of the company’s stock ahead of other series of stock.

Board of Directors: The proper balance between investor, company, founder and outsider representation. VCs will often want to include an observer as part of the agreement either instead of or in addition to an official member. Many investors will mandate that one of the common-stockholder chosen board members be the then-serving CEO of the company.

Protective Provisions: Veto rights that investors have on certain actions by the company.

Drag Along: If a majority of the holders of Series A preferred agree to a sale or liquidation of the company, the holders of the remaining Series A preferred and common stock shall consent to and raise no objections to such sale.

Anti-Dilution: Used to protect investors in the event a company issues equity at a lower valuation then in previous financing rounds. There are two varieties - weighted average and ratchet based.

Pay-to-Play: An investor must keep participating pro ratably in future financings in order to not have the preferred stock converted to common stock.

Redemption Rights: The concern on the VC’s part that a company will become successful enough to be an on-going business, but not quite successful enough to go public or be acquired. These allow the investor a guaranteed exit path. The average venture fund has a 10-year life span to conduct its business. If a VC makes an investment in year five of the fund, it might be important for that fund manager to secure these in order to have a liquidity path before the fund must wind down.

Conversion: In an IPO of a venture-backed company, the investment bankers will want to see everyone change to common stock at the time of the IPO. The thresholds are critical to negotiate – as the entrepreneur; you want them lower to insure more flexibility while your investors will want them higher to give them more control over the timing and terms of an IPO.

Conditions Precedent to Financing: These include clauses such as “Legal Fees and Expenses”, “No Shop Agreement”, and “Governing Law” which are explicitly agreed by the investors and the company to be binding upon execution of this term sheet. Additionally, these also include actions such as “Approval by Investors’ partnerships”, “Rights offering to be completed by Company” and “Employment Agreements signed by founders as acceptable to investors.” As an entrepreneur, make sure you understand the key terms such as compensation and what happens on termination.

Vesting: If the founder leaves the company before the stock fully matures, the company has the right to buy back shares at the price paid by the founder, typically a very low price, close to nothing.

Information Rights: VCs are ultimately investment managers. This provision allows them to monitor their investments as well as satisfy their reporting obligations to their investors/limited partners; and taking institutional money requires companies to mature and put in place appropriate reporting and governance structures.

Registration Rights: Entitles an investor who owns restricted stock to require that a company list the shares publicly so that the investor can sell them. If exercised, these can force a privately-held company to become a publicly-traded company.

Right of First Refusal: Part of the stock purchase agreement that is signed during a venture capital fund raise. It requires any shareholder who wants to sell stock - common stock, preferred stock, etc. - to give the VCs the choice to purchase those shares before allowing any other party to buy them.

Voting Rights: The power to make decisions on behalf of the company, such as approving budgets, hiring executives, raising capital, or selling the company.

Employee Pool: Consists of shares of stock reserved in a private company. It’s a way of attracting talented employees to a startup company—if the employees help the company do well enough to go public, they will be compensated with stock.

Restriction on Sales: Referred to as preventing stockholders from selling within a certain time period or until a certain valuation has been reached; subjecting sales of stock to consent by the board of directors and/or other stockholders; and giving some stockholders right of first refusal on the sale of others' stock.

Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement (PIIAs): Prohibit employees or contractors from disclosing for personal gain or on behalf of a competitor. By signing the agreement, individuals acknowledge their responsibility to maintain confidentiality during and after their engagement with the company.

Co-Sale Agreement: Contractual obligations used to protect a minority shareholder, usually in a venture capital deal. If a majority shareholder sells their stake, it gives the minority shareholder the right to join the transaction and sell their minority stake in the company.

Founders Activities: ​Specifies that founders must spend 100% of their professional time on the company. If a founder wishes to work on another project, they must get approval from the company's board.

Initial Public Offering Shares Purchase: A venture capital-backed IPO refers to the initial public offering of a company previously financed by private investors. Venture capitalists use VC-backed IPOs to recover their investments in a company. Investors wait for the most optimal time to conduct an IPO to make sure they earn the best possible return.

No Shop Agreement (also Unilateral or Serial Monogamy): A confidentiality agreement prohibiting founders from using the term sheet to solicit offers from other potential investors, who don’t want you using the terms of their deal to gain leverage with another firm—allowing it will let investors know you’re pursuing this term sheet in good faith.

Indemnification: A provision in a term sheet is a commitment by the company to defend and compensate board members in the event of litigation and/or settlement relating to the venture capital financing or the directors work on the company's board.

Assignment: A provision in a term sheet specifying that the investor may transfer some or all of their shares to a partner or closely related entity. This provision allows investors to move shares between funds and make distributions to their limited partners.
